Pip-Boy OK-200 is a personal project aiming at reproducing the Pip-Boy from the video game Fallout 4 in a web browser,
while making it the support of my curriculum vitae.

## Potential improvements

In order to make the Pip-Boy screen more "realistic", it would be possible to add CSS animations in order to reproduce
the aspect of an old CRT screen (scanlines, "shakes"...).

## Comments on code quality

I am a back-end developer, and this project aimed to develop my front-end skills. I tried to produce the cleanest code
possible, but it is still a reflection of a learning process, so it looks very imperfect in hindsight.

In particular, the CSS positioning is open to criticism, and must therefore be viewed with a critical eye.
