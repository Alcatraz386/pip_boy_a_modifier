Pip-Boy OK-200 is a project aiming at reproducing the Pip-Boy from the video game Fallout 4 in a web browser.

The project is hosted here : 

The rendering is much better on a desktop or laptop. The smallest screens (some smartphones for example) are not
supported, the pip-boy screen will stay off (or the display will be broken if you manage to make it buggy...).

## Comments on code quality

I am beginner. So I will not modify a lot the original code.

## Licence

This project is licensed under the GPL-3.0 License. You can freely fork this project, study it, modify it, etc. If you
want to publish your own fork, you must publish the source code of this one, under the same GPL-3.0 License.

Crediting the original author of the project (Cyril Berthout) is not formally required, but it would obviously make him happy. :)

## Issues / Bugs

The layout is completely broken on some iPhones (6 / 7 in particular) + Safari browser.

The layout is disturbed when zooming via the browser.

Some "header-lines" positioning issues on some configurations whose perimeter remains to be identified.

Bad positioning of the map which causes an overflow on the header.

Work in progress...
